- Sick-Beard API for marking as 'Watched'.
  When a player is spawned, watch how much time the User spends in it. If the time spent is 20%+ of the
  episode length, mark the episode as 'Watched'.

- Delete after watching -- automatically mark episodes which have been 'Watched' up deletion.
  Allow deleting (to 'Trash') using the 'Del' key or similar.
